ðŸ“š CS61B: Data Structures (UC Berkeley)

Iâ€™ve completed most of the CS61B course from UC Berkeley, which focuses on data structures and algorithms using Java. Although I havenâ€™t finished Project 2 and Project 3 yet, I plan to return to them in the future.

This course starts with Java fundamentals and gradually moves into more advanced topics. It helped me not only understand Java better, but also gain a solid foundation in computer science.

âœ… What I Learned
â€¢	Java basics: how to override compareTo, equals, hashCode, hasNext, next, etc.
â€¢	Writing unit tests with JUnit
â€¢	Data structures: queues, stacks, linked lists, hash tables, trees, heaps, and graphs
â€¢	Algorithms: sorting, searching, shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, dynamic programming
â€¢	Time and space complexity analysis

ðŸ“Œ Next Step

Iâ€™ll continue learning data structures and algorithms by taking MITâ€™s course (which uses Python). It will help reinforce my knowledge and improve my Python skills as well.

ðŸ’¬ Personal Note

As a second-year computer science student close to 40, studying abroad with limited English skills, this journey has been full of challengesâ€”moments of doubt, frustration, and multiple failed submissions. But through it all, I kept going.

To anyone who is also learning and struggling: donâ€™t give up. Stay consistent. Keep pushing forward. You are not alone.
